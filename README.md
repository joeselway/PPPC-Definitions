The "*Enabled*" description refers to when the app list is populated, i.e. after an app has requested access.

The "*Disabled*" description refers to when the GUI only presents a message regarding apps that have requested access appearing instead of an empty list.

"*Always enabled*" refers to options such as Accessibility which offer +/- buttons even when the list is empty.
